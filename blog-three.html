            <h2>What is a Web Framework?</h2>

            <p>
                A web framework is a software platform designed to assist in the
                development of web applications, services, and APIs. It provides
                a standardized way to build and deploy web projects, offering
                features like:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Routing:</strong> Managing how application URLs are
                    handled.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Templating:</strong> Enabling dynamic generation of
                    HTML pages./li>
                </li>
                <li>
